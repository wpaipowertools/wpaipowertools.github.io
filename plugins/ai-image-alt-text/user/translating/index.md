This plugin makes use of WordPress's community translation capabilities. All necessary strings in the plugin code are localized and we have included a .pot file. As such, if you would like to contribute to translating this plugin, you can do so via the Translating WordPress portal, which can be accessed here:

[Translating AI Image Alt Text](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/ai-image-alt-text/)

If you would like to contribute to translating the plugin, we would encourage you to also join the Slack channel for your locale (language), to stay in touch with translation editors who can approve your translations and/or to become a translation editor yourself. You can find information about the different WordPress language translation teams here:
