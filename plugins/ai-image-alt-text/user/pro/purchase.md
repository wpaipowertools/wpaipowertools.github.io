Alternatively, you can [visit the plugin website](https://www.wpaiplugins.dev/wordpress-image-alt-text-ai-plugin/#prices) and choose the plan you would like.

## License Options

There are four license options for this plugin. A single-site license, a 5-site license, a 10-site license and a 25-site license. All four give you the same access to the full pro version, including all features. The difference is the number of sites you can access your license on.

For developers or those that need to run the plugin on multiple sites, we offer multi-site licenses. You can see that these are heavily discounted when compared to the single-site license. Keep that in mind when making your decision. If you think that, at any point, you will need to activate the plugin on more than one site, it might make more sense to buy one of the multi-site licenses, to save money.

## Receiving Your Download and License Key

As soon as you complete the purchase, you will have access to the [my account on portal](https://www.wpaiplugins.dev/log-in/) on our website where it will display your license key and a link to download the pro version add-on plugin. 

With these, you can now [activate the pro version](activate).
