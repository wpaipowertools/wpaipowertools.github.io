2. Click **Sign Up**.

## Step 3: Create an API Key

1. In the dashboard, look for your **profile menu** in the top-right corner.
2. Click **View API Keys**.
3. Press the **+ Create new secret key** button.
4. Give your key a recognizable name (e.g., “My App Key”).
5. Copy the generated key **immediately**—you won’t be able to see it again later.

⚠️ **Important:** Store your key somewhere safe. Treat it like a password—never share it publicly.

You're now ready to [add your key in the plugin](adding-key).
