Here we cover how to create an OpenAI account and generate an API key, which is necessary to run the alt text generation in the plugin.

## Step 1: Create an OpenAI Account

1. Go to the official OpenAI website: [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Click **Sign Up**.
3. Choose to sign up with your **email address**, **Google account**, or **Microsoft account**.
4. Enter your details and complete the verification steps (you may need to confirm your email and phone number).

✅ Now you have an OpenAI account.

## Step 2: Log Into the OpenAI Dashboard

## Step 3: Create an API Key

1. In the dashboard, look for your **profile menu** in the top-right corner.
2. Click **View API Keys**.
3. Press the **+ Create new secret key** button.
4. Give your key a recognizable name (e.g., “My App Key”).
5. Copy the generated key **immediately**—you won’t be able to see it again later.

⚠️ **Important:** Store your key somewhere safe. Treat it like a password—never share it publicly.

You're now ready to [add your key in the plugin](adding-key).
