If you are not able to find the answer to a question or issue in the documentation, then you can reach out to us for support. 

[Visit our support center to contact us](https://www.wpaiplugins.dev/contact/)

Our support is handled via email, Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm EST (North American Eastern Standard Time). 

Pro customers receive first priority and, under normal circumstances, should usually receive a response in 8 business hours or less. Other emails are replied to after this and should usually receive a response within 3 business days, depending on support volume.

Please make sure to provide us with as much detail as you can for any issue you are facing, as well as the URL to your website and any screenshots that might help.

## Debug Logs

Before getting in touch, make sure to [enable debug mode in the plugin and check the logs](../settings/logs#debug-logging). It may give you your answer before even needing to reach out, or, at the very least, you can provide us with the log right away, so we can help you to address the issue more quickly.
