title: Bulk Generating and Scheduled Regeneration of Alt Text
---
With the [pro](../pro) version of the [WordPress AI Alt Text Generator Plugin](https://www.wpaiplugins.dev/wordpress-image-alt-text-ai-plugin/) you can bulk generate alt text for an unlimited number images. 

To do this, use the **Quick Actions** menu found on the **License** settings page.

The Bulk area of the settings page gives you full control over this action. There you can choose to skip images with existing alt text, include/exclude specific folder paths and limit the number of images.

## Scheduled Regeneration

If you would like to run bulk generation automatically, you can also set the **Cron Interval** (on the same settings page, seen in the screenshot above).
