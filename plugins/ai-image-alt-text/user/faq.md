Quick answers to your most common questions. Anything missing? [Let us know](https://www.wpaiplugins.dev/contact/).

## <a name="openai-key"></a> Do I need an OpenAI API key?

Yes. Youâ€™ll need to create a free or paid account with OpenAI and obtain an API key to use this plugin. You can set your model (e.g. GPT-4o, GPT-4, or GPT-3.5-turbo) and control costs through the settings panel.

We've prepared a tutorial on how to create an OpenAI API key [here](openai-key).

## <a name="overwrite"></a> Will it overwrite existing alt text?

No. The plugin skips images that already have alt text unless you explicitly choose to regenerate them.

## <a name="accessible"></a> Is the generated alt text accessible?

Yes. The descriptions are designed to be accessible and readable by screen readers, and you can choose different generation styles (descriptive, simple, SEO-optimized, etc.).

## <a name="woo"></a> Does this work with WooCommerce or Elementor?

Yes, any images uploaded to your Media Library are supported, regardless of the page builder or theme.

## <a name="bulk"></a> Can I regenerate alt text for all images at once?

Yes. Use the bulk generate tool in the plugin dashboard. It will process all eligible images with missing alt text.

## <a name="support"></a> How do I contact support?
