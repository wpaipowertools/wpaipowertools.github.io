The pro version of the plugin comes with a feature that works with plugins like Yoast to provide an SEO score for the image(s) include on a page or post. To make use of this, first ensure that you have installed and activated an SEO plugin like Yoast.

After that, in our plugin's admin, go to **Settings > SEO Score** and toggle on the **Enable SEO Scoring** option. Here you will also find several other options to fine tune the SEO scoring feature.

Now, when you upload a new image directly via the post/page edit screen, including the featured image, that image will be tied to that post/page, and, when you use our plugin to generate alt text for that image, it will be given an SEO score based on the content of the page and, if selected in the options, the keyword set in Yoast. You can see the score for the best-rated image in the sidebar of the post edit screen.
