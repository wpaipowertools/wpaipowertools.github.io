The pro version of the plugin comes with the ability to fine tune the keyword recommendations. Navigate to **Settings > Semantic Keyword Recommendations** to find all these options.

Here you can specify related terms and long-tail suggestions, and even specify certain terms that you would like to exclude.

You can also set a density target, meaning how often a keyword should come up in the content (in percentage).
