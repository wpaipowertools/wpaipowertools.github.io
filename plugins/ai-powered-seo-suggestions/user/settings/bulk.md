With the [pro](../pro) version of the [WordPress AI-Powered SEO Plugin](https://www.wpaiplugins.dev/wordpress-ai-powered-seo-plugin/) you can automate the re-scoring of and meta generation for your posts.

If you go to **Settings > Bulk & Automation**, you can toggle on the **Enable Scheduled Rescore** option to enable all these feature.

After doing this, the plugin will create a cron job that runs at an interval you specify and that will automatically trigger the re-scoring for the SEO of all your posts.

If you would like it to also bulk generate any missing meta, just enable the **Auto-generate Meta if Missing** option.
