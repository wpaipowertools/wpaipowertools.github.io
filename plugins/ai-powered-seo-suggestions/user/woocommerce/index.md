The pro version comes with the ability to automatically enable the plugin's SEO tools for WooCommerce products. It also provides extra features specific to WooCommerce, such as the ability to use the short description for meta, set a default product schema type and use attributes as keywords.

To enable the WooCommerce integration, go to **Settings > WooCommerce** and toggle on the **Enable Product SEO** option.
