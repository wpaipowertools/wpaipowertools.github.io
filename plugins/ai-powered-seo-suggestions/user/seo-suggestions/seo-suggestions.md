As long as you are [connected to OpenAI](../openai-key) and have [selected at least one SEO plugin to integrate with](../prerequisites), the plugin will automatically create SEO suggestions for your pages and posts. 

To view the list of generated suggestions, simply go to the post or page edit screen and find the **AI-Powered SEO** panel in the sidebar.

Here you will see the suggestions are divided into keyword hints and fix-it tips.

## Regenerate Suggestions

If you are modifying a page or post and would like to get live feedback on the SEO for its content, you can click the **Refresh** button under either the keyword hints or the fix-it tips to get an updated list of suggestions for the current content!
