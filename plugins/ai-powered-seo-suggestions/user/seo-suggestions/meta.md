**AI-Powered SEO Suggestions** also comes with the ability to generate AI-driven meta titles and descriptions for your posts and pages that match the content and tone of the page/post and your site. 

To generate a unique meta title and description, simply go to the page/post edit screen, find the **AI-Powered SEO** panel in the sidebar and scroll down to find the **SEO Title** and **Meta Description** fields. Here you will see the current values for those fields, and, if you wish to generate a new meta title and description, just click the **Generate with AI** button.
