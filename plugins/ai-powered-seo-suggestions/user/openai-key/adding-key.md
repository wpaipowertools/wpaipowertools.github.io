Once you have your OpenAI API key, you can insert it in the plugin settings by opening your WordPress admin, going to **AI-Powered SEO Suggestions**, then to **Settings** and then to **General**. There, in the **OpenAI** section, you will find the **OpenAI API Key** option. Insert the key there and then make sure to scroll down and save the settings page.
