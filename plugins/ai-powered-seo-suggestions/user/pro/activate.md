To activate the pro version of the plugin, you need your license key and the pro version add-on plugin zip file. Both of these were provided at the time of purchase and can also be retrieved at any time by [logging in to your account portal](https://www.wpaiplugins.dev/log-in/). There, in your order history, you will be able to see your existing license keys and download the latest version of the add-on plugin.

To install the pro version add-on plugin:

1. Go to the **Plugins** page in your WordPress admin area.
2. Click the **Add New** link at the top of the page, and then the **Upload Plugin** button on the next page.
3. Locate the plugin zip file on your computer and select it.
4. Click **Install Now** and then activate the plugin.

Once the plugin is installed and activated, return to the **License** tab on the plugin settings page. There you will find a field called **License Key**. Paste your license key in that field and then click the **Activate** button.

Once it says it has been successfully activated, refresh the settings page and you should see that it now says the license status is valid.
