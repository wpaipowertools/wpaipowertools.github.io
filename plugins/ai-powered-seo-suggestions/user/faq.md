Quick answers to your most common questions. Anything missing? [Let us know](https://www.wpaiplugins.dev/contact/).

## <a name="openai-key"></a> Do I need an OpenAI API key?

Yes. You’ll need to create a free or paid account with OpenAI and obtain an API key to use this plugin. You can set your model (e.g. GPT-4o, GPT-4, or GPT-3.5-turbo) and control costs through the settings panel.

We've prepared a tutorial on how to create an OpenAI API key [here](openai-key).

## <a name="overwrite"></a> Will this overwrite my Yoast/Rank Math/SEOPress/AIOSEO fields?

No. The Lite version provides AI suggestions and optional manual fields. It does **not** overwrite existing plugin meta unless you explicitly save values into those fields.

## <a name="free"></a> Is there a free AI feature?

Yes. Lite includes **AI Semantic Keyword Hints** (up to 2 terms) and **AI Fix-It Tips** (up to 3 tips). Pro expands these with more terms, variants, bulk tools, and deeper guidance.

## <a name="woo"></a> Does it work with WooCommerce?

Lite analysis works on product content; advanced product-specific tips and schema helpers are in Pro.

## <a name="slow"></a> Will this slow down my site?

Results are cached per post. There’s also a setting to run analysis **only when a target keyword is set**. AI requests are short and use a small, fast model by default.

## <a name="yoast"></a> Is this a replacement for Yoast or Rank Math?

No. Keep your existing SEO plugin for sitemaps, schema, and global SEO. This plugin **complements** them with AI-driven on-page suggestions and editor guidance.

## <a name="gdpr"></a> Is the plugin GDPR friendly?

Content sent to OpenAI is limited to what’s necessary (title, headings, target keywords, analyzer summaries). Review OpenAI’s policies for data retention. You can disable AI features anytime.

## <a name="support"></a> How do I contact support?

We provide the best support for the free plugin that we're able to provide for free. But there is only so much we're able to do while keeping the business sustainable. Still, we'd encourage you to [post your support request on the official forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ai-powered-seo-suggestions) and we'll help out as best we can.

If you are using the pro version of the plugin, please reach out to us via the [support center on our website](https://www.wpaiplugins.dev/contact/).
